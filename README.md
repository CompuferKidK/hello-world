# hello-world

Hi I'm computerKidk. I'm rather new to coding and decided this would
Be a good place to learn or at least immerse myself in it. I'm in school at 
University for computer science and have a love of coding. I've loved it since our
Family got our first computer (real computer besides our commodore that just sat
Under its dust jacket) in 1988. It was a PS1 and My brother and I took computing
Classes. We learned how to use DOS and C prompt cuz those were the only two ways to code
At the time other than straight up "10110001001110" binary code my uncle Dick did for a living teaching 
Me the best lesson I learned in computers; you only need 2 fingers to type 1 and 0. Lol. But that 
Kind of computing at present is beyond my comprehension. I'm pleased to meet you.
